# Machine learning project for student Market segmentation using Kmeans Clustering Algorithm 
Project Overview:
<ul>
<li> Achieved data analysis and data cleaning of the student database  </li>
  <li> Created a boxplot for the age of the students in order to reconganize and remove the outliers </li>
  <li> Performed Data preprocessing by entering Dummy inputs for the gender colunm </li>
  <li> Performed regressive Kmeans and used the elbow point to determine optimum number of clusters </li>
  <li> Plotted a bar chart between number of clusters and their frequencies </li> 
</ul>

# Code and resources used:
<ul>
  <li>Python version- 3.9</li>
  <li>Packages- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn, StanderdScaler, Cluster</li>
  <li> Tools and algorithms- Google colab, stopwords, train_test_split, MultinomialNB, confusion_matrix, classification_report, Kmeans </li> 
</ul>
